To run this program, you need to execute the file 'Sistema de tickets.exe' in the debug.w32 folder.


This was my first big program made 100% by myself.

It is a CRUD application about selling products in which you can use your code bar scanner to scan the product. 
As a CRUD, you can create, read, update and delete them.
Also, you can administrate your client list, order them and search a specific one.
When you start making the list of products, with the first scanned (or passed by code) product, it will tell you the ticket number it will have on top.
When you finish making the list of products, you can either save it (Guardar) or print it (imprimir).
  - The first one, will save the list in a ticket history.
  - The second one, will do the same as the previous point plus create a .txt file with all the details in \debug.w32.
